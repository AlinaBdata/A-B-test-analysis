#### Project description: 
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.
The purpose of the A/B test is to test changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system.
